This project introduces a comprehensive word frequency analyzer designed for efficient text analysis, implemented using a hash table and a min-heap data structure. The application enables users to seamlessly input text, analyze word frequencies, and identify the most frequent words, providing a dynamic and user-friendly interface. Leveraging the advantages of a hash table, the system ensures swift insertion and lookup operations for words, accommodating the evolving nature of text data. The min- heap is utilized to maintain the top frequent words efficiently, allowing for quick retrieval of the most common words. The user interface is intuitively designed, allowing users to input text, analyze word frequencies, and display the most frequent words effortlessly. The program reads input text, converts it to lowercase, tokenizes it, and stores word frequencies in a hash table. It then builds a min-heap from the hash table to identify and display the most frequent words. This project showcases technical proficiency in data structure implementation, emphasizing the significance of efficient data handling and user-centric design. Robust error handling mechanisms enhance the stability of the application, addressing unforeseen errors and ensuring reliable performance.
